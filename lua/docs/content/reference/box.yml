type: "Box"
description: |
    A Box represents a volume axis-aligned to a given space : it is defined with only two [Number3], a minimum and a maximum, which represent the extents of the box along the axes of that space.

    For example, a [Shape].[BoundingBox](/reference/shape#property-boundingbox) is axis-aligned to the model space of that shape, pertaining to its blocks.
    However, an [Object].[CollisionBox](/reference/object#property-collisionbox) is axis-aligned to the world space of the scene, like most physics-related boxes.

    When using or creating an axis-aligned Box, be mindful of what space it is relevant to.
constructors: 
  - description: "Creates a default Box with no volume, or with given minimum and maximum points."
    argument-sets:
      -
      -
        - name: "min"
          type: "Number3"
        - name: "max"
          type: "Number3"
    samples:
      - code: |
          -- creates a box with both min & max = {0,0,0}
          local box = Box()

          box = Box({0,0,0}, {10,10,10})

properties:
  - name: "Min"
    type: "Number3"
    description: |
        [This] minimum point representing the lower extent along the axes.

  - name: "Max"
    type: "Number3"
    description: |
        [This] maximum point representing the upper extent along the axes.

  - name: "Size"
    type: "Number3"
    description: |
        Size of the box from its minimum point. This automatically sets [This.Max](/reference/box#property-max).

  - name: "Center"
    type: "Number3"
    read-only: true
    description: |
        [This] geometric center point.
    
functions:
  - name: "Copy"
    return:
        - type: "Box"
    description: |
        Returns a copy of the [Box].

  - name: "Fit"
    arguments:
      - name: "target"
        type: "Object"
      - name: "recursive"
        type: "boolean"
        optional: true
    description: |
        Sets the box to a bounding box fitting the given target's model and all its descendants if the optional parameter `recursive` is `true`.

  - name: "Merge"
    arguments:
      - name: "b"
        type: "Box"
    description: |
        Sets the box to the combination of both boxes.
